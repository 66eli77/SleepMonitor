SleepMonitor
============
An iOS to Android app
because at the moment I don't have an Android phone around for testing, 
I have to use the touch input to minic the accelerometer sensor data.
just touch the upper part of the screen(color coded), the X coordinate reading is to be used for chart ploting.

the App currently has 3 working Activities and one tabbar hosting Activity
the chart animation is a surfaceview running on a seperate thread, being displayed on the first Activity
